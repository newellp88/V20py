# Introduction

This is an example of how to use and customize the ["non-official OANDA V20py package"](https://github.com/hootnot/oanda-api-v20). 

'
$ pip install oandapyV20
'

It is intended for educational purposes, to get proficient Python users up to speed quickly with the basics of automated forex trading, and nothing else. This project could be extended with professional portfolio and money management tools, and potentially with websockets and PySpark Streaming for better connections and tighter control of streaming data.
